#  Skylog
Skylog is a freeflight logger. Enabling glider pilots to record their flights and the weather conditions for future reference. It's a bit of a pet project that I intend to add user accounts, interaction with geolocation API, back-end database. I think I'll add in the Open Weather API to get historical weather data.
